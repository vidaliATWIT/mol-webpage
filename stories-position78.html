		<h3>"Position 78"</h3>
		<p id="story">
			In every reality there is an instance when a train explodes in Medford station. I’m certain this is true. I’ve seen it in my dreams. Usually at 3:13 pm. Not always. Sometimes it happens late at night. No fatalities. Of course I’m always there watching it. I don’t get hurt because I wake up. It’s always somewhere else. It’s never the same day either. Except three times it happened on May 5th 1993. That was yesterday.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I wasn’t always afraid. I used to think it had already happened. That I had missed it. I wasted many weeks going through back issues of local papers but no mention. No one even knew to look out for it. Except the woman. She never spoke, but the look she had gave it away. She pretty much lived at the station, but never went past the third to last step down. That’s when the wall gave way to the open hall, leaving you exposed to the most gruesome death you could ever imagine. She knew it was coming.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Eventually she disappeared. I heard she gave out one day while going up the steps. She was young. When they tried to wheel her down the steps into the train her body went stiff and the wheels on the cart stopped dead. It was bad for the medics too, because it was the height of winter so there they were carrying a stiff dead woman across the city for no reason at all while being pelted by snow and hail. That I saw.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I was smoking a cigarette on the cross between Trent, and Wooly. Coincidentally I was on the way to the station. She was beautiful. Even dead as she was, she looked more alive than the two men carrying her around. It helped that she was wearing a fine dress that day. Impressive in of itself as she never gave any impression other than of slovenly disorder. Maybe she knew. Obviously the trip to the hospital was absolutely useless. Except that’s what the man had told them to do. He was a large man in a large suit who turned them around at the turnstyle. More than the wheels or the stiffness, this man would not allow them to take her into the train. I’d never seen him there. He appeared almost by divine mandate. Most likely a stranger who though unaffected by the woman’s invisible war with public transit, saw a conflict reflected in himself. The greater never ending struggle against individuals, ideas, peoples, races, ideologies, and oneself.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			She’s dead though, and I’m not. I still go to Medford station every day and I sit down and I wait. It would be easy to not go. I just have to stop. But I’m no deadbeat. I have a job, a family. I’m responsible, so every day twice a day to and from I go there and I sit and I wait. There are a hundred other stations like Medford, spread across the city. I could weather the brief inconvenience every day in the knowledge that I would live forever. But what would I become? The minutes I would waste walking to Lindberg and then switching would eventually become another life. I would be split in half. One following the roadmap laid out before me, as in every other possible world, and another who breaks every day for a couple of minutes, and this one would live forever and remember in converse the life that he should be living. My life.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Then when the minutes reach the year he will split apart from himself once more and I will find myself forgetting for a moment that routine. I would revert, unconscious and walk down the steps of Medford station in time to suffer the full extent of the blast.
