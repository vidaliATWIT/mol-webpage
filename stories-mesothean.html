		<h3>"The Mesothean Catalog"</h3>
		<h4>"On Noise"</h4>
		<p id="story">
			The sound from the bathroom is driving me insane. The woman in her office has fallen asleep and I can hear her snoring. Then when I come out she’s standing at the doorway. And she looks at me with that shellac grin until I go back to my office. And then when I do there’s that incessant hum. The fan from the A/C unit. It groans and rumbles like some hellbound creature calling toward the mercy of the faulty god that created it. And a faulty god he is. To create humming you have to be quite the incompetent codger. And to create pens and keyboards that click and clack. In an ideal world the tools of humanity would be quiet. Click pens would eject their tips without sound. Keyboards would type without the mechanic registers that resort to clicking for haptic response. But this is not an ideal world. This is the cursed world created by an incompetent codger God. 
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			And the pens and keyboards click away, the clock of my impending snap. Every click the injection of a vaccine in my head which will prevent peace; happiness; calm to settle, to spread. These are the worst viruses.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Lately I’ve taken to stealing pens from everyone in the office, then snapping them in half. The second phase of this plan will be breaking the keyboards, stealing one per day, then deconstructing it at my desk. Once this is done I will remove the switches, then place them back. Soundless. Perhaps useless as well. Would it that keyboards could work without those lousy switches. The third phase will be smashing the A/C unit with a hammer. Finally I’ll acquire a latrine and place it out in the parking lot. It will be difficult, but it is possible.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I realized today that my rank in this office is befitting of such requests. An overseer. The woman who stands outside of the bathroom thinks so too, grinning. I wonder if she thinks the same thing when she’s sleeping. She always wakes up before I can ask her. I must have woken up before. But I don’t remember falling asleep. I’ve heard no one does. I’ve heard that. I wonder if she’ll think the same thing tomorrow. After we both wake up again. After one of us decides to go to sleep first.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I must be an overseer because no one else has the time to complain. Everyone else is deaf to it. But I am not. I can hear it. Click. Hum. Snap. Crash. Beep. Click. Click. Click. Snap.
		</p>
		
		<h4>"On Narrative"</h4>
		<p id="story">
			All events cascade like skipping stones on a lucky pond, cristallike, lifeless, ripe for ideological wishes, stories, lies. That is, a narrative can only be linear. Irregular structures are still laid from point A to B even if not within the story’s fictional temporal setting. As far as the reader is concerned, that irregular structure is linear, even as it differs from the natural expectation between narrative and temporal cohesion and synchronicity.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Cortazar attempted a displacement for the reader, skipping around pages, sometimes consequence or sometimes doesn't of chapters aparat. However, that became the new linear sequence for the reader, merely replacing the expected one. It is still from A to B to C and so on, only then this linear progression masquerades as 73 to 1 to 2 and 116 and so on. The events still cascade;the new linear is still linear. Narrative is linear because perception is linear. It cannot be disrupted unless the mind is tampered with. The author rescinds any insinuations apparent with the formal statement. Conclusively, structure is not in the hands of the writer, it is in the hands of the reader. So throw your books in the water and watch them skip.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			In this way an experiential neurosurgeon portends the most avant-garde of literary expositions. The lobotomite, the unassuming modernist reader, capable of ordering, reordering, forgetting and annihilating structure and all sense linear and otherwise.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Hence, the author will suggest the reader poke a stick through their nose until it touches their brain. Then the reader must massage the gray mass inside their skull with the stick. Then choose a book, the most mundane book in your possession, perhaps a manual or terms and agreements sheet. And once your brain is suitably massaged, read the book and watch it shine in newfound post-modern irregularity.
		</p>
		<h5>Foonotes:</h5>
		<p id="story">
			1. The off-kilter reading order still makes for a notable difference between the reader’s experience of the narrative. If you read it in Cortazar’s eschewed order as opposed to the chronological or standard order, you come out with a much different experience of the text. This does not mean the fundamental formal structure of the narrative itself changes. In either case the reader still consumes a linear narrative, formally speaking.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			2. Postcript: If she were to color herself she’d find such things as candid laughter, anagrams for love and a girder glow that glistens softly across boards of cured wood in a play of lost childhood lost there on. And on the eve of the winter’s first morning the finished sketch shall walk on of her own hand colored through for the gallery of man to see. And on that night the bells shall ring true and the moon gleam bright an ode to the nameless presence that gifted her sight. 
		</p>

		<h4>"On Vision"</h4>
		<p id="story">
			We live in the reality where micro-computers and home entertainment carried the evolution of technology. Virtual reality is still futurism. To think you can experience a state of being, outside of your circumstances, like falling through the hole into wonderland. Still under the tree, but down the rabbit hole as well. Both at the same time. For just under a thousand dollars as well. A marvel. Wondrous times.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			This is the reality we’ve chosen. Not flying cars. Not intergalactic colonization. Virtual reality. The natural evolution of cellphones and game consoles. Significant power discovered early, and developed to great effect over decades. Aided by the connection afforded by these technologies.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Consider: a boy assumes a female form in a multi-user digital social experience and is objectified, lusted over and abused for the gratification of another. A fiction. No harm no foul. One must wonder what the boy thinks. We all hope he can sleep well. And the man, the accoster, a loneliness transcendental. Enough to see the boy as a woman. Like the ancients. To be pushed to such an act. A channelization, urges unaccepted but channelled. A disconnect. He didn’t see or touch anyone. He was alone in his room. A wastrel in filth, or in hellish tidiness. Exact. Precise. Precisely.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			But we must ask the boy. We hope he can sleep well. The man cannot sleep. But he didn't touch or see anyone. In 10 years he’ll be blind. In 50 he’ll be dead. And the boy will be a man. We’ll ask him again, then. For our studies. They’re important. Of course they are. The research will be conclusive. Of course it will be. Man in the virtual age. And all I can hope is that I will be dead by then. That or that I can jack into a perfect recall of a vapid childhood memory. A scraped knee before supper. My older sister crying over something I still am not old enough to understand. But perhaps my wife is also there. As if we were good friends back then. And we’ll play pretend. I’d be a race car driver and she’d be an escaped convict. Watch out. It would be fun. The sun always setting. That or death.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			That’s all the author can ask of this life. The one with virtual reality. And so this is the author. And the author prefigures his future: he will resort to codetalking and vacant lyricism before either future can pass. But he will be coherent for now. I hope the boy can sleep.
		</p>

		<h4>"On a Performance Betrayed</h4>
		<p id="story">
			You pay an entrance fee for exclusivity. You pay for a promise of an experience. A matrimonial bond between audience and performer. “You promised you’d be true!” There’s an inherent hierarchy; you are more “there” than those who were not in attendance. After a certain decade, this promise was more of an unfounded claim. A lie. Anything can be captured. All performance archived. Bootlegged. So then, those who were not, now can be. And they who captured the performance can be again. And again. So now does the price of admission mean anything?
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A uniqueness, a first who was there, precedence. But all performance is disorienting to presence. Does precedence undermine presence. A fully comprehensive experience; that allowed by a careful examination of the performance captured. Replaying in a controlled environment. The concept of performance is therefore unbalanced, in disarray.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			As an ecosystem, it has failed. The moment a performance is captured, a truer version already exists. The copy more real than the original, which is transient. It exists forever. And in its permanence achieves the fulfilment of the audience’s unwilling expectation- to remember the event.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			The fact is a performance is forgotten, not every detail will be remembered. Most will be forgotten. The author will argue that all details will be forgotten and replaced with imagination. The sketch made from memory. No perfect recall to instruct the recollection. An outline, sure, but drawn with the impermanent inks of a faulty archiving system. But the copy, the artifact is forever, it can repeat. It will repeat. Let it repeat.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			And what of the woman who said thank you twice heard on the left spear at 14 minutes and 3 seconds? All the clapping, jokes, the performers unheard but these, you only have to make it louder. Everything is captured. The unheard is unheard, not absent. There is no absence. Every day logged. All performance artifact.
		</p>

		<h4>"On a Smaller Deluge and a Large Fire Dreamed"</h4>
		<p id="story">
			Last night I dreamt that a fire burned and would take with it my home and all of my belongings. It would eventually reach me on my mattress on the ground and, blown by the fan would ignite my bed sheet which would in turn consume me in flame, then ash. The fire was started by the chance movement of the plugged soldering iron onto a wooden box that holds all of the guts and electronics of a dozen little machines. Everything was lost because no matter how I argued against the silent judge, the one silent judge, reason, logic, the mathematics inherent to all occurrences that are observed or experienced, there was always a wooden cupboard, or an upholstery chair, or a stack of books. An infinite amount of objects chained in an infinite number of ways to reach one conclusion.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			In all scenarios objects were lost, in some I was lost. In this scenario, the midnight paranoia caused by dehydration and the urge to work, the urge to fix, a vague notion of forgetting, would mean there was no escape. I would die.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Once more I would count how many minutes before the fire started downstairs, how many more before it reached the kitchen, up the sofa, climbed up through the bookcase, leaped onto the paintings on the stairs then to the door, the rug, onto the curtains, lining up to reach me. By then, I could wake up. Drop and roll. For no cause- I sleep cocooned by blankets, mummified in the implements of my comfort, protection against some dream pleasurable, or nightmare obscene. In this state I would be awoken by a sudden heat, doomed to the blind fury called immolation.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			The alternative was not better, survive that death and be forced to leap from the second story window. If the fire reached this far, the door would no longer be a viable escape, to say nothing of the front door, adjacent to the flame’s origin. The only exit would be to leap out into the pool. But the distance is too great. Without a run-up, some kind of forward push, I’d never clear the concrete walkway that skirts the water. Even then, at least a quarter of my body would slam down onto the walkway. I’d either lie broken, half dry, or drown aching as the fire carried on.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I awoke and no fire came, instead I resumed my work. Fruitless, pointlessly so. I burnt my ring and left fingers with the iron. Later I would spill a glass of water on a collection of books, and I would feel loss bordering on anguish. This was the fire. The stock I put into objects. Artifacts. Returning to artifacts. I wanted to own these books as they were, just moments before they were logged. It wasn’t the content, that was already consumed, it was the objects themselves, in a perceived state of perfection. Untouched, dry, safe. Safe? Unhindered by the elements alien to their material.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Now unpresentable. Absconded. They’ll be put in a box and sealed. Emotional ties critically strained. Then cut. Underperforming as aesthetic proof, visual cues of knowledge retained. Just loss now. Fire. The water to put out the fire.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			The collector mourns, the purchaser mourns, the owner mourns. I owned them, and now I would that I never had, so that the small misfortune of spilling water on a dozen books did not compel me to replacements for a dozen books already purchased, read and aligned as furniture. But to do so would render me collector over reader. An object fetishist. I would have to accept that I own books for the object, not the knowledge, a blank book with a title and author, under the pretense of knowledge. Times 12.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Were it I could take my chances with the window and the fire.
		</p>

		<h4>"On Mass Hypnotism</h4>
		<p id="story">
			I’m sure someone complained when it was the books. Before that, just tallies, word games, primeval crosswords about crops and lunar cycles, some idyllic past for generations of land reformists to piss themselves in the joy of remembering them. That’s really when it began. Man wrote his own entrapment, much like the dog that chases his own tail.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			It’s improbable anyone complained when it was their book, their story: them and one the israelites. Recorded, read aloud, repeated. The pendulum of narrative. Ogling at the magic of god on the page. A curse- to exist only in reference. In narratives, stories, linear structure. Linear structure. A funny mountain diagram with the beginning, middle and end. And that structure mimics the life of every person born and died. Beginning, middle and end. Born, live, die.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			But ever since the first word was put on the page, when man enacted his curse, we have existed in the same condition, the form will change, the format will change, but on the page god, through magic. On the television the very same. And the lists go on.
		</p>

		<h4>"On Lunacy Befuddled"</h4>
		<p id="story">
			The moon commands impressions befitting its namesake. Schoenberg’s Pierrot proves testament. “Den wein den man mit Augen trinkt.” To devour these impressions. Allow them entrance into the mind’s inner chamber. Most clowns would go mad. Most people would go mad. To think a cosmic presence older by exponents than any being currently alive on the earth. Watching. Its eminence is not immediate, blinding. It is quiet. A mirror for the cosmos. The visions it brings are to be expected. It’s not that a being of immense knowledge and wisdom hides behind the moon. The moon is that being. Stare upon it. You’ll see it.
		</p>

		<h4>"On Death and the Dustman"</h4>
		<p id="story">
			Consider a dust so thick and persistent it formed a person. In all other aspects this being of dust was assuredly and boringly human. It has a weak bladder and cannot drive despite it being well into adulthood. However, dust it is. It hardly speaks to anyone; on occasion a faint wheezing sound in order to call attention to itself. Otherwise it is content to waste away the days in utter silence going through repetitive motions in a pantomime of a human life. In public transit it sits, yet cannot watch. It has no eyes, it may not even have a brain. This being of dust is seemingly moved by nothing at all, yet it still moves.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Thinkers everywhere deign to find the answer: god, or something else, a will, luck, spare time. But these are all wrong. Dust no matter how coagulated or persistent will always be subject to the whim of the wind.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			This being like every other of its kind will eventually be blown away to return to the dirt, a feast for the roots of higher life forms farther past the point of comprehension than anything feeble enough to be motivated by the unknown forces; feeble enough to question it.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			This particular wretch died in a car crash. A bull crashed into the car it was in one evening on the freeway. The driver was alright. The thing dissipated completely on impact. The car was totaled. Neither was missed. It was a company car. They never found the bull’s owner.
		</p>

		<h4>"On Unpleasant Thoughts"</h4>
		<p id="story">
			The nights go on. And then one day the doctor will say you’ve got a month. And the nights will go on. If not you, someone else, like you but someone else. And they’ll have those thoughts as well. And the nights go on. And each doctor, doomsayers, prophesied will in turn perish at some trigger oblique and unspoken. And a record will be kept. And the nights will go on. But the howling won’t cease. That cat isn’t coming back. Would it the nights had end, so that everyone would return. Some bell high above ringing marking the end of a conflict primeval, forgotten. But only when the children of men are returned to the fire of their conception, and the babe of god’s mercy--unscathed, blue-eyed, no markings, hairless--is sacrificed to the wild beasts. Torn apart, devoured. And the nights will go on.
		</p>
		<p>   </p>
		<h5>Foonotes:</h5>
		<p id="story">
			1.  Two eyes poke through murky water and cleave the woman through. To clutch her heart and close her eyes, the pond a wretched mire. Unseeming sightly being stood inverted in the wade. A butchered corpse- the lover’s dream. Asleep awake beneath.
		</p>

		<h4>"On the Transmogrification of Man"</h4>
		<p id="story">
			A dozen atrocities for every breath, gasp, cough and sneeze. One per person born on the year of a census counting as well the entire ancestry and lineage thereof. Debt to be paid in full every year, benefits reaped bi-monthly. It’s a good deal she says behind the counter, smiling. Flashbulbs cracking her domed head like an eraser filed down white. But you better hope for that hurricane, otherwise you’ll dream of the ratman, the first in this country’s history. And he has many more tricks. Pray for the hurricane.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Then is it a number? A quota. A cleanse in the furtive birth certificates passed in silence between officials, tax collectors and infranational agents and nurses. A silent exchange occurring on the whim of a second by the millions. Signed and sealed, delivered by people that look like the day’s postal agent, but on eccentric routes, through strange hours. You misremembered the insignia long enough to be tricked into a false memory. The car’s all wrong. Factory error. Misproduced, mass produced officers of a state between states, and among them. To and from, the paper cascading onto the hands of the woman behind the desk. The woman asleep at her office. The woman at the door. Fog, light behind faded glass. The buzz unnatural of the fixture. Signed and delivered. En route to the collection offices .  Hospitals, garages, cars, bathrooms- through thick and thin, life and death, day and night, always keeping track. For every breath, gasp, cough and sneeze, a dozen atrocities.
		</p>
		<p>   </p>
		<h5>Foonotes:</h5>
		<p id="story">
			1.  I sat on a mattress. There on the wall, mold. In this room a woman was murdered. Brutalism. A debt collected. And there it was. The mold. Looking at me.
		</p>

		<h4>"On the Snatcher"</h4>
		<p id="story">
			Filling a notebook page by page with grafts, profiles, traces and calcs of every single object in existence. A tiring mission for a being past sleep. Consumes the word, written or spoken and records it just the same. Bones, fossilized, crystallized thought. An estimation of humanity. A guess hazard of life. And his face is gray and sooted. A facade of age, wisdom, betraying his babelian innocence, still not separate, still within his own age, in his own write. His eyes strained, count seven. He dresses in a long dark garb and wears a hat unmarked, an accoutrement of his position. And he shall give no reflection in the waters of the dead. Yet his eyes meet not those of the living, lest they be cast into his book as well. And his tools are sharp and his inks plenty. The page dry, the hand steady. An expanse of existence there to conquer. To record.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			And on a defined day of every solar year, he will sit atop the bone tower hidden in the bog of man’s treachery; the site of the first betrayal. And he will share all there is to know- inversions of all knowledge. And religions will be made, and they will segment, break and know war. And the leaders of men will be cast down in their accursed knowledge, oblivious to its origins. And books will be written, obscuring it further still. And then he will cease embodiment, and assume a perpetuity transmutant; within every artifact; every idea put to paper; every line spoken. The entire catalog of man. And in obscurity he will reign, every-expanding and eternal.
