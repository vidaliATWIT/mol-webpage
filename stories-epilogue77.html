		<h3>"Epilogue 77"</h3>
		<p id="story">
			In the damp vacuum of the night after a heavy rainfall, a man is walking down a dirt path from the wilderness to town. As he clears the vine and tangle he is recognized by gamblers in games who turn to him. The motley murmur among each other as he approaches, gatekeepers of a long misplaced pact settled between man and beast in the first years of this land.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			“Where have you been?” said the one nearest the man as the distance closes. His brow is matted and the sweat dripping from his head evokes crying.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			“I was working."
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			“For that long?” A few chuckles from the men behind him. "I guesss you don't know then."
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			“What?”
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			“Migdalia gave birth just hours ago. A boy. Everyone else is over at the midwife’s. Some of us too inebriated to appreciate the grandness of it all decided to wait here in case you decided to come back.”
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			Having descended the path during this exchange, the man now stood at the threshold of the small group. In the glare of the lamp the men could see he was weathered: his face dark and thickly bearded. His clothes were tattered and filthy. The man looked down at himself and sighed.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			“I’ll wash up.”
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			The man had arrived home and shaved to the fan’s incessant rattle. As he did, he looked directly into the mirror. His face, now trimmed, awaiting the final reap of the next blade, was set with streaks of grease and grime, the depth of which had gone unnoticed by the party of scraggles that received him. He opened behind the mirror, set down his trimmers and took out his razor. He turned the faucet, splashed his face with one hand, and turned it off. Looking at the razor and then the mirror he noticed for the first time in many years how different he looked.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			In seven quick strokes he was sheared, the hair pooling in the drain. He looked again at his own face in the aftermath of this most mundane of rituals. The man realized something, and laughed. His hollow cackle was accompanied by the noise of the fan which grew louder and louder until it snapped, crashing heavily onto the living room and simultaneously knocking the power out of the room.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			There was only the sound of crickets and treefrogs. Within the house there was only darkness.
