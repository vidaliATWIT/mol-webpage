		<h3>"Gulley 00"</h3>	
		<p id="story">
			Slowly the entire room was relieved of all its furnishings. Through the weeks in which this anonymous pilfering occurred, nothing was seen of the room's occupant. Even when the men were first known and gave notice, took credit for the emptying, still nothing was seen of him. And then they saw it, cold and stiff on the ground. A decaying effigy affected in the name of a simple life.
		</p> 
		<p id="story">
			It was a silhouette drawn on the floor in chalk. It looked like an overturned candle, but it was in the image of a person. It was the only marking in that room which had otherwise been relieved of even the wallaper.
		</p>	
		<p id="story">
			As the days passed the owner of the house recast the walls, painted over the holes, and changed the light fixtures. The checks had stopped coming in, and he needed a new tenant. In all his attempts of reverting the room to a habitable state, he could never erase the silhouette. It wasn't just drawn, it was branded into the floor. In the end he simply placed a bed frame over it, like before. The other rooms in the house came to be voided as well, but these were soon occupied. The third room, however, remained vacant.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			A year since the disappearance, the owner began receiving checks again, unsigned, no return address. A bogus go-between being the official source of the money. A man whose job it was to keep such transactions private. Soon after, he began hearing faint sounds through the door to the room. Eventually he noticed items misplaced. Intuitively, one morning he checked under the bed and confirmed that the mark was not there. All that was left was to wait.
		</p> 
		<p id="story">
			So he slept, and years later when the home was in ruin, consumed by dust, mold, and the creatures who thrive in disuse, he would walk into the room and see the man sitting at his desk, trapped in an eternal daylight untouched by time. Far away from any force human or otherwise that would sacrifice him in the name of this or any other life.
