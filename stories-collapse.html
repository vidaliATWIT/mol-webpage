		<h3>"Collapse the Rotting Wall"</h3>
		<p id="story">
			And I had thought God’s pestilence had come to an end. This supremacist streak of disbelief stirred once more by an unseemly sight to match the solitary hells of expatriate soldiers and middling housewives intertwined in crises of menopausical proportions. On that strip of red brick which twists around the road southward there was a cloud of flies. Every few steps I would see them again, moving on otherworldly winds on that damp day to stick to the wall opposite. They would swarm towards me, large vicious flies with horns. More than once I had come in contact with creatures of this ilk, only then did I understand from whom they came. 
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			The day’s slanted sun revealed the fissure, as another’s gloomy clouds parted to likewise reveal a slit between two claustrophobic slabs of concrete in the heart of that winding city. Because it was not that wall- I continued to see them stuck on the faces of buildings farther down, miles past that endless curve. I would think I was rid of them and I would see them again.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			I’m certain now the wall that birthed them, or the wall between whose plane and intersect a gate split wide open, was not material. It was the rotting wall, itself existing between the curtains of our flickering mortal fabric. These creatures then were but a single instance simultaneously existing within and without the mind of the observer. At once at the beginning, middle, and end of his journey. The movements they performed repeated a dozen times as far down as the next township, only if that walker’s trek did reach there.
		</p>
		<p id="story">
			It was not until I afforded the shelter of a tavern’s grace did the vision cease. But even now in the shade of a woman’s pure tone I believe they remain. I hold steadfast within the cellar, as I have for years since I first saw them and I shall not rise again until the plague of flies dissipates, and the fissure is closed once more. A second before and I will slip into that other plane between a morning’s sun and that wall with no end.
